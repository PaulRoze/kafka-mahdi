In the infinite streams of data, kafka-mahdi stands as the beacon for those who seek to maintain order and integrity within their Kafka clusters. May it serve you well, guiding your messages across the vastness of distributed systems.

## Overview
`kafka-mahdi` serves as a crucial tool in the ecosystem of Kafka, aimed at ensuring the synchronization of consumer group offsets across Kafka clusters. Drawing inspiration from the prophetic themes of *Dune*, this script acts as the Lisan al-Gaib, bridging the gaps between disparate data realms with precision and foresight.
## Features

### Script Functionalities
- **Consumer Group Extraction**: Identifies and lists all consumer groups from the source Kafka brokers.
- **Offset Application**: Adjusts consumer group offsets to ensure consistency across clusters.
- **Topic Listing**: Reveals all topics within a Kafka cluster, providing insights into the available data streams.

### Automated Update Checks
- The script checks for its latest version at startup and prompts for an update if a newer version is available.

## Prerequisites

To utilize `kafka-mahdi`, you must have:

- Docker installed and running on your machine.
- Access to Kafka clusters via specified brokers.
- Basic knowledge of Kafka administration and operations.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/PaulRoze/kafka-mahdi.git
```
2. **Add execution permissions:**
```
cd kafka-mahdi;
chmod +x kafka-mahdi.sh
```

3. **Execute the script with the following options to harness its capabilities:**

```bash
./kafka-mahdi.sh -h  # Display help and command options
./kafka-mahdi.sh -cg  # Extract consumer groups
./kafka-mahdi.sh -cgo  # Apply consumer group offsets
./kafka-mahdi.sh -t  # List all topics
```

## Script Help
To access the help menu for detailed usage instructions, run:
```
./kafka-mahdi.sh --help
```

## Logic Flow
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is Help Requested?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Show Help];
    B -- No --> D{Determine Action};
    D -- List Consumer Groups --> E[Extract Consumer Groups];
    D -- Apply Offsets --> F[Apply Consumer Group Offsets];
    D -- List Topics --> G[List All Topics];
    E --> H[End];
    F --> H;
    G --> H;

```
## Sequence Diagram
```mermaid

    participant User as User
    participant Script as kafka-mahdi.sh
    participant Kafka as Kafka Cluster

    User->>Script: Execute with option (-cg, -cgo, -t)
    alt is -cg
        Script->>Kafka: Request Consumer Groups
        Kafka->>Script: Return Consumer Groups
        Script->>User: Display & Save Consumer Groups
    else is -cgo
        Script->>Kafka: Apply Offsets
        Kafka->>Script: Confirm Offsets Applied
        Script->>User: Display Confirmation
    else is -t
        Script->>Kafka: Request Topics List
        Kafka->>Script: Return Topics List
        Script->>User: Display & Save Topics List
    end

```
